allowed-tools: Read Write Edit Glob Grep Bash
compatibility: Requires the canopy-runtime skill (published at github.com/kostiantyn-matsebora/claude-canopy). Install with any agentskills.io-compatible tool — e.g. `gh skill install`, `git clone`, the repo's `install.sh`/`install.ps1`, or the Claude Code plugin marketplace. Supports Claude Code and GitHub Copilot.
description: Authors, validates, improves, scaffolds, and refactors Canopy skills using a structured control-flow notation (IF, ELSE_IF, ELSE, SWITCH, CASE, DEFAULT, FOR_EACH, BREAK, END, ASK, SHOW_PLAN, VERIFY_EXPECTED). Use when creating, modifying, debugging, or reviewing skills under `.claude/skills/` or `.github/skills/`, when the user mentions canopy, ops, control-flow notation, or skill scaffolding, or asks to convert a regular skill into a Canopy skill (and vice versa). Supports both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot.

> **Runtime required.** This skill uses Canopy tree notation; canopy-runtime must be active.
>
> **Detect canopy-runtime** — present if either:
> - `canopy-runtime/SKILL.md` exists under `.claude/skills/`, `.github/skills/`, or `.agents/skills/`, OR
> - a canopy-runtime marker block exists in `CLAUDE.md` or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
>
> **If neither is present** — install canopy-runtime first (see the `compatibility` field for the source and install options), then re-invoke this skill.
>
> Do not interpret the `## Tree` without canopy-runtime active.

## Rules

- Never overwrite existing files without confirmation
- For ops that target a specific skill (IMPROVE, MODIFY, VALIDATE, SCAFFOLD, CONVERT_TO_CANOPY, CONVERT_TO_REGULAR): if the skill name is not stated explicitly, ASK before proceeding — never infer from natural language descriptions or loop over multiple skills
- Always show a plan before making any changes
- Preserve the skill's existing tree syntax style (markdown list vs box-drawing) unless the user asks to switch
- Preserve the skill's existing directory layout (legacy flat vs. standard `scripts/`/`references/`/`assets/`) during MODIFY — IMPROVE may migrate it on user opt-in
- Do not change a skill's logic or intent during CONVERT_TO_CANOPY, MODIFY, or VALIDATE
- SKILL.md must contain only orchestration — no inline JSON, YAML, tables, scripts, or templates
- Skill files must be exactly `SKILL.md` (uppercase) — case-sensitive filesystems require this
- Skills with `## Tree` must have a `compatibility` field declaring canopy-runtime requirement and a safety preamble guard block at the top of the body
- Frontmatter root contains only spec-allowed fields (`name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools`); `argument-hint` and `user-invocable` go inside `metadata`
- Framework primitives (IF, ELSE_IF, ELSE, SWITCH, CASE, DEFAULT, FOR_EACH, BREAK, END, ASK, SHOW_PLAN, VERIFY_EXPECTED) are never defined in skill or project ops — they live in `../canopy-runtime/references/framework-ops.md` (loaded up-front by the tree; ops can reference by bare name `framework-ops.md`)
- Before creating any op or resource file, consult `framework-ops.md` (already in context) and any existing project-wide ops the consumer has defined — reference shared content, never duplicate it
- After any change to a skill or agent file, verify every `Read \`<category-path>/<file>\`` reference and every op procedure path still resolves to an existing file
- The platform runtime spec (`../canopy-runtime/references/runtime-claude.md` or `../canopy-runtime/references/runtime-copilot.md`) is loaded up-front by this skill's tree and is in context for every op procedure
